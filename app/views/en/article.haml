    %h3 Introduction
    %p Internet is a tool that changed the way the world communicates by shortening the distance between mankind. It has turned into an indispensable tool for many economic sectors, not to mention all of them.  Even the traditional or conventional media like the newspapers use Internet and benefit from it. And it also has created new forms of sharing information, where to do it in real time and in a second is something normal for many people.
    %p When it started the web was static. Most of the sites were created with rudimentary HTML. They weren’t frequently updated and only a few people were in charge of uploading, erasing and editing the information.
    %p All the technology began in a transformation process and as expected Internet wasn't the exception because with the apparition  of web 1.5, websites represented something more than just showing information: now it was number of visits and visuals. They evolved into dynamic sites because it was the beginning of the data base use: storing and presenting important data from users and the beginning of programming languages completely focus in to the Internet like ASP and PHP.
    %p The web presented an evolution in its traditional applications which started to focus in final user needs as we know the main player. With time, it was very common to find sites with plus value or service which started to change in how business were made  and also to change our daily behavior.
    %p Today it is usual to find sites offering plenty services which are part of our life like movie streams, view-edit-share online docs, buy & download music, Bank Online transactions, etc. And if we analyse deeply we will find that must of this sites are North American or European but why Mexico doesn't create this kind of sites?
    %h3 Could be it the lack of qualified personnel?
    %p The level of Mexican engineers is enough, and this is proven when international corporations like Siemens, Ooyala, HP, Tata and Oracle begin to build offices in our country. Also demonstrated with Microsoft’s recruitment programs done in several universities of Mexico to hire recently graduated engineers. On the other hand, there are 100% technological focused corporations like Hildebrando and Softeck which demonstrate the obtained success.
    %h3 Is it the infrastructure?
    %p Internet monthly subscription with a speed between 2.5 and 15 Mbps costs $91.29 approx, projecting Mexico as the country with the most expensive Internet service in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. And it is not only expensive, Mexico has an average of 4.29 Mbps speed which posts it in the place number 77 under countries like Jamaica, Laos and Vietnam. Something really amazing.
    %h3 ¿Culture does affect it too?
    %p Most of Mexican businessmen haven't realised the real potential of the Internet as a tool of sharing alternatives to conventional commerce. They use sites only for publicity instead of adding a plus value to their company.
    %p On the other hand Mexican users haven't got all the necessary trust to Internet and neither exist new options to push it to new limits. And those with technical knowledge live with the commodity of a job with a stable payment few interest in a better life and to risk in entrepreneuring.
    %p We need a Mexican Mark Zuckerberg to make an example to Mexican youth of how getting successful by innovation and effort not by stealing ideas and bench marketing them.
    %h3 Government is a bureaucracy facilitator?
    %p If the project needs to be settled legally and formally it is a complex procedure which can take several months. Once settled we have to face to a complex tax system in which is not clear on how to proceed and if we don't have a talented accountant it can be very expensive.
    %h3 Drivers of change.
    %p There are people who knew how complicated it is, but they decided to use their experience and share it to those interested in entrepreneur in the technological field anyway. Some examples are:
    %h4 Startup Weekend Mexico
    %p The main objective is to create a viable business in one weekend and it makes people with different profiles to meet and develop it. This is done with the help of instructors guiding and advise.
    %h4 Startup Factory
    %p In Start-up Factory they are dedicated to develop and funding technological projects in early stages of rising. Based in models like Y Combinator, Idealweb and Innovation Works but adapted to Mexico’s conditions.
    %p With advise in Standford and Sillicon Valley’s methodologies they help the project to have an optimal development procedure in areas like Commercial, Organisational and development of the product with iterative. Feedback is obtained eith high profile business and technical mentors all this is done in a work place with other people focused in develop new projects in Mexico with Sillicon Valley’s style.
    %h4 Fondeadora
    %p It is a new form of getting funds for our project it is not selling neither getting investors or a loan. As the project creator you have the control to develop it the only thing you have to do is offer original rewards to attract possible funding to your project. If the funding necessary is not obtained or limit surpassed the money is returned to the funders without problems. This way if the goal isn't accomplished nobody is obligated to pay.
    %h4 Startup dojo
    %p This is a intensive week program where attendees can develop specific points of their project with a series of 10 sessions of basic topics, also facilitate advise and tools for product development or service.
    %p The principal objective is that attendees gain practical knowledge to consolidate their project. The last edition was made May 23 to 27 in the CANIETI facilities with 13 projects. The next edition will be in fall and the announcement is open.
    %h3 But YES! there are successful projects in our country!
    %p Without doubt there are Mexican examples of sites which offer multiple functionalities more than providing information. A clear example of this is SAT, in where any thing can be done in their site. Except for registering new tax payers. The employee’s system is web based.
    %p A sector more active in this branch is the Financial where banks have invested a lot in online bank services and also in mobile apps. 
    %p I would like to mention the effort of several State Governments for making possible the concept of e-government bye creating informatic places to make procedures in a easy and fast way avoiding bureaucracy.
    %h3 Conclutions (or suggestions)
    %p Mexico is a fertile zone to technological projects, always looking to focus in specific problems of the region those who are common in Mexico. It is important to look for advise of specialized people who can guide our project to avoid problems. A very important point to enforce our project is to associate with skilled people in which we don't have their skills.
