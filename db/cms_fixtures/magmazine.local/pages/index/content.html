Hello luchadores &amp; luchadoras,

Greetings from the Magma Rails Crew! We have had a little more time to regroup and gain force to think about Magma Rails 3. However before anything happens we would like to introduce you to this little product called Magmazine.

But before anything else, we would like to take some time to thank all of those who traveled from their comfortable homes and spent the night of Tuesday October 11 in Manzanillo or Colima, when Jova hit. We know that we can get your time back but we have a hugh compromise with you organizing a high quality event and we hope not to let you down.

Sorry for those who during their journey, had to get back to their home. It wasnt our intention to cancel the event, but the information and recommendations provided by authorities guided us to make all the decisitions. The cancelation was something that happened as a result of JOVA hurricane landing in Manzanillo and the effects of it.

Those who made it for “2da Caída”, very thank you for supporting us. We couldnt let pass those who gladly gave their speach in a long conference day.

To the speakers: Thank you for coming and speak with a small crowd and in a less conventional space. Because of people like you developers communities exist as an authentic knowledge and product sharing.

This Magmazime is a humildity effort for providing a product which helps to remember the experience for those who came and those who didnt. We hope with our hearts this pleases you and if dont remember you can always send ud suggestions and constructive critics to info@magmarails.com.
